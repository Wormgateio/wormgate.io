Running services with Docker containers

For run the application, containers with the database need to be initiated using docker-compose. To do this, you can use the file located at`.docker/docker-compose-infra.yml`

Command to start containers with services:
```bash
$ docker-compose -f ./.docker/docker-compose-infra.yml up -d
```

You may need to create a localhost network with a command:

```bash
$ docker network create localhost
```

Before starting the application, it will be necessary to execute the command in `packages/front`
```bash
$ npx prisma generate
```

# Add new chain via seed
1. Add new chain in в prisma/seed
2. Run command: `npx prisma db seed`


# Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page-old.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
